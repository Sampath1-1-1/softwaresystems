//Daemon process run in the background, allowing them to perform tasks or provide services without requiring user interaction.
// Daemons often run continuously or at scheduled intervals
// many types of Daemon createDaemonProcess
// system deamons-init/systemd: System initialization daemons that handle system startup and service management.
// udevd: Handles device events and manages device nodes in /dev.
